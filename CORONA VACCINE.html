   <h2>CORONA VACCINE TYPES</h2>
   <br>
   As of January 2021, nine different technology platforms – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined[clarification needed] – are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[3][27] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.[27] Platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[14][27][33][34]
   <br>
   Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms.[27][33][34] Several of the synthetic vaccines use a 2P mutation to lock the spike protein into its prefusion configuration, stimulating an immune response to the virus before it attaches to a human cell.[88] Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation, and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.[27][33]
   <br>
   An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.[89][90][91][92]
   <br>
   RNA vaccines were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union.[93][94] As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine[95][96][97] and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.[98][99] As of February 2021, the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac is awaiting authorization in the EU.[100]
   <br>
   Severe allergic reactions are rare. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.[101] For 4,041,396 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose administrations in December 2020 and January 2021, only ten cases of anaphylaxis were reported.[101] The lipid nanoparticles were most likely responsible for the allergic reactions.[101]
   <br>
   These vaccines are examples of non-replicating viral vector vaccines, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS‑CoV‑2 protein.[102][103] The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID-19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.[102]
   <br>
   As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,[104][105][106] the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine,[107] Convidecia, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.[108][109]
   <br>
   Convidecia and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.[110][111]
   <br>
   The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine uses Ad26 for the first dose, which is the same as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine's only dose, and Ad5 for the second dose. Convidecia uses Ad5 for its only dose.[112]
   <br>
   Inactivated vaccines consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response.[113]
   <br>
   As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Chinese CoronaVac,[114][115][116] BBIBP-CorV,[117] and WIBP-CorV; the Indian Covaxin; and the Russian CoviVac.[118] Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.[119][120]
   <br>
   Subunit vaccines present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles. The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen.[121]
   <br> 
   As of April 2021, the two authorized vaccines of this type are the peptide vaccine EpiVacCorona[122] and RBD-Dimer.[3] Vaccines with pending authorizations include the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine,[123] SOBERANA 02 (a conjugate vaccine), and the Sanofi–GSK vaccine. The V451 vaccine was previously in clinical trials, which were terminated because it was found that the vaccine may potentially cause incorrect results for subsequent HIV testing.[124][125]
   <br>
   Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include virus-like particle vaccines, multiple DNA plasmid vaccines,[126][127][128][129][130][131] at least two lentivirus vector vaccines,[132][133] a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein.[134]
   <br> 
   Oral vaccines and intranasal vaccines are being developed and studied.[135]
   <br>
   Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‑19 infection.[136] There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19.[137]
   <br>
   Vaccine efficacy is the risk of getting the disease by vaccinated participants in a controlled trial compared with the risk of getting the disease by unvaccinated participants.[139] An efficacy of 0% means that the vaccine does not work (identical to placebo). An efficacy of 50% means that there are half as many cases of infection as in unvaccinated individuals.
   <br>
   It is not straightforward to compare the efficacies of the different vaccines because the trials were run with different populations, geographies, and variants of the virus.[140] In the case of COVID‑19, a vaccine efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the pandemic, but this assumes that the vaccine confers sterilizing immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission. Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‑CoV‑2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious.[141] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set a cutoff of 50% as the efficacy required to approve a COVID‑19 vaccine.[142][143] Aiming for a realistic population vaccination coverage rate of 75%, and depending on the actual basic reproduction number, the necessary effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to need to be at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and at least 80% to extinguish it without further measures, such as social distancing.[144]
   <br>
  In efficacy calculations, symptomatic COVID-19 is generally defined as having both a positive PCR test and at least one or two of a defined list of COVID-19 symptoms, although exact specifications vary between trials.[citation needed] The trial location also affects the reported efficacy because different countries have different prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 variants.[citation needed] Ranges below are 95% confidence intervals unless indicated otherwise, and all values are for all participants regardless of age, according to the references for each of the trials. By definition, the absence of a confidence interval means that the accuracy of the estimates without an associated confidence interval is unknown to the public. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a public health burden whose prevention is a priority.[145] Authorized and approved vaccines have shown the following efficacies:
